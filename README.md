# Represent API: Archival Data

[Represent](http://represent.opennorth.ca) is the open database of Canadian elected officials and electoral districts. It provides a [REST API](http://represent.opennorth.ca/api/) to boundary, representative, and postcode resources.

This repository stores digital boundary files that have been superceded by newer data sources. The [represent-canada-data](https://github.com/opennorth/represent-canada-data) repository has all the current boundary files. 

The [represent-canada](http://github.com/opennorth/represent-canada) repository is what's running at [represent.opennorth.ca](http://represent.opennorth.ca/).

See the [represent-canada-data](https://github.com/opennorth/represent-canada-data#readme) README for more information.
